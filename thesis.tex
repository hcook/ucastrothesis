% Page layout. The fancyhdr package may complain about the need for a
% larger headheight, depending on how long chapter titles are; if left
% unspecified in the geometry setup, it defaults to 12pt. The
% "showframe" option causes the geometry package (version >= 5.0) to
% show a frame around the margins on every page, which is great for
% checking that you don't overflow anywhere.

The ultimately solo process of completing this document forced me to truly reflect
on how much I have relied on my collaborators all throughout this epic journey.
I want to thank all of my Berkeley colleagues, and in particular acknowledge
those who had the most influence on the path of my thoughts over these years.
Chris Batten, Bryan Catanzaro, Sam Williams, Shoaib Kamil, Zhangzi Tan, and Miquel Moreto
offered the wisdom and compassion of their mentorship.
Armando Fox, Brucek Khailany, and Jonathan Bachrach each served as my third advisor in their own way.
Peter Bailis and Peter Alvaro gave me direction in my most uncertain hour.
Katya Gonina, Michael Bauer, Adam Israelevitz,
Sarah Bird, Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman
were my peers who gave me the most to build on,
and who pushed me the hardest to deliver on my promises.

I joined Berkeley at a time when the computer architecure group was just coming out of hibernation,
and its been a privilege and a pleasure to watch it blossom.
From shivering in the recesses of 420 with Scott Beamer and Sarah Bird;
to the sunlight of the Cosmic Cube with Chris Celio, Andrew Waterman and Adam Israelevitz;
and beyond to all the Barchitects, past and future, thank you for working together to make this happen.
Andrew Waterman and Yunsup Lee still want to keep working with me.
Here's to the next big thing.

I would never have survived grad school without a strong support network.
My fellows students kept me sane, in particular
Jake Abernethy, Ariel Kleiner, Angela Brooks, Alexandra Meliou, Peter Bodik, Yuni Kim,
Andy Konwinski, Beth Trushkowsky, Rob Carroll, Kurtis Heimerl, Adrienne Felt, Mark Murphy,
Kevin Klues, Erin Carson, Nick Knight, Katya Gonina, Eric Battenberg, Nick Jalbert, Edgar Solomonik,
Lisa Fowler, Isabelle Stanton, and Brian Gawalt.
Apartment 21 was my home for the entirety of this thesis, and what would that have meant without
George Schaeffer, Erika Chin, Eric Love, Jonathan Harper, and Palmer Dabbelt.
Tyler Schnoebelen, Michael Schuler, Chad Stose, Jacob Wolkenhauer, Robert Zamora, Robert Lawson, Matt Hagenian,
Scott Remnant, Jeffrey Hodges, Joel Ryan, Sam Grossberg were my gay mafia, and 
Kirk McKusick and Eric Allman provided their own brand of mentorship.
Andrew Waterman, Sarah Bird, Steve Hanna, Maggie Brown, Joseph Pirtle, Noah Benson, Sam Luckenbill, Matt Holte
and helped me explore the world, push my limits, and climb to new heights.
Chris Grier and Kurt Thomas were the best men.
Of course, none of this work would have been possible without the help, empathy, encouragement, support and love
 of my husband, Michael Armbrust.
